# "Numerous sources say Joe Biden's using counterfeit Pokemon cards fabricated by the communist party in China"

Numerous sources are alleging that President Joe Biden is using counterfeit Pokemon cards fabricated by the communist party in China.

These sources, who wish to remain anonymous, claim that Biden has been using these fake cards in an effort to gain an unfair advantage in his Pokemon battles with other world leaders.

"It's just not fair," said one anonymous source. "Biden is using these fake cards to win battles and it's not right. The communist party in China is known for its counterfeiting operations, and it's unacceptable that Biden is benefiting from their illegal activities."

Another source claimed that they saw Biden using the fake cards during a recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"I was there and I saw it with my own eyes," said the source. "Biden pulled out these cards and started using them in the battle. It was obvious that they were fake. Putin was furious and called him out on it, but Biden just shrugged it off like it was no big deal."

The White House has yet to comment on these allegations.

This is not the first time that Biden has been accused of using fake Pokemon cards. In 2019, he was caught using fake holographic Charizard cards during a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The use of counterfeit Pokemon cards is a serious offense in the world of Pokemon battling, and if these allegations are true, it could have serious consequences for Biden and the United States.

Only time will tell if these allegations are true, but in the meantime, it's important to remember that cheating in Pokemon battles is never acceptable.
