Narrator: "Welcome to today's exciting match between the Red Sox and the Yankees. The tension is high as both teams battle it out on the field. The Red Sox are up by one in the bottom of the seventh inning. Let's go to the commentators for more analysis."

Commentator 1: "Thanks, narrator. It's a tight game here at Fenway Park. The Red Sox are looking strong, but the Yankees are not giving up without a fight. It's anyone's game at this point."

Commentator 2: "That's right, commentator 1. The Yankees are putting up a good fight, but the Red Sox are holding their own. It's an exciting game for the fans here in the stands and watching at home."
Suddenly, a loud crash is heard and the commentators gasp.

Commentator 1: "Oh my god, what was that?!"

Commentator 2: "It sounds like something has broken into the speaker booth! Everyone, stay calm and quiet. We don't want to enrage whatever it is."

The commentators can be heard whispering frantically as the camera pans to the field where the players are looking confused and scared.

Commentator 1: "We need to call for help, but we need to do it quietly so as not to agitate the intruder."

Commentator 2: "I'll try to reach the control room and see if they can contact security. In the meantime, let's keep talking about the game as if nothing is happening."

The commentators continue to narrate the game, but their voices are shaking and their words are rushed. The camera pans back to the speaker booth where a large gorilla can be seen pacing around.

Commentator 1: "This is unbelievable. We have a gorilla in the speaker booth and we need to get out of here before it gets any worse."

Commentator 2: "I can't reach the control room. I think they've been taken by the gorilla as well. We're on our own here."

The gorilla suddenly notices the commentators and charges at them, causing them to scream in terror.

Commentator 1: "Oh god, it's coming for us! We need to get out of here!"

Commentator 2: "It's too late, it's right on top of us! AHHHHHHHH!"

The commentators' screams can be heard as the gorilla rips off their limbs in front of live television. The audience is shocked and horrified as the camera cuts to a commercial break.
